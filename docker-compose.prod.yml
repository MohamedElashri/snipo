# Production Docker Compose with enhanced security and resource limits
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
#
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES FOR PRODUCTION:
# 1. Use SNIPO_MASTER_PASSWORD_HASH instead of SNIPO_MASTER_PASSWORD
#    Generate with: docker run --rm ghcr.io/mohamedelashri/snipo:latest hash-password
# 2. Store secrets in Docker secrets or a secrets manager (not in plain .env files)
# 3. Enable network isolation (uncomment networks section below)
# 4. Use a reverse proxy with HTTPS (nginx, traefik, caddy)
# 5. Regularly update the image and rotate passwords
#
# DATABASE MEMORY CONFIGURATION:
# For production environments with limited resources, consider reducing database memory usage:
# Add these environment variables to prevent "out of memory" errors:
#   - SNIPO_DB_MMAP_SIZE=67108864    # 64MB instead of 256MB
#   - SNIPO_DB_CACHE_SIZE=-1000      # 1MB instead of 2MB

    # Network isolation (recommended for production)
    # Uncomment to use custom network:
    # networks:
    #   - snipo_network

# Optional: Create isolated network for production
# networks:
#   snipo_network:
#     driver: bridge
#     ipam:
#       config:
#         - subnet: 172.28.0.0/16
